## does not currently reflect the substituted command's real exit
## status in shish (a separate, pre-existing issue outside the scope
## of these three fixes).

## fixes/19: a pipeline inside a subshell used to leak its builtin
## members as extra copies of the interpreter -- "(true | true)"
## made everything after the subshell run 3 times instead of once.
